# connectFourSolver
Game-playing AI system for Connect Four.

To run the game:
`$ python connect_four.py`  to play (as a human) against our AI
`$ python connect_four.py -a`  to play (as a human) against our AI with alpha-beta pruning
`$ python connect_four.py -t n`  to pit our AI against an agent that makes moves randomly, and print the results after n trials.
