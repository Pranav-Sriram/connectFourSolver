# connectFourSolver
Game-playing AI system for Connect Four.

To run the game:
`$ python connect_four.py -d`  to play (as a human) against our AI without alpha-beta pruning
`$ python connect_four.py -d -a`  to play (as a human) against our AI with alpha-beta pruning
'$ python connect_four.py -d -a -f' to play (as a human) against our AI with the AI making the first move
`$ python connect_four.py -t n`  to pit our AI against an agent that makes moves randomly, and print the results after n trials.
